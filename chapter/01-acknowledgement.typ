#heading(level: 2, outlined: false, numbering: none)[Acknowledgement]

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, *Prof. Mandar Mitra*, for his constant guidance, encouragement, and insightful feedback throughout the course of this dissertation. His expertise and support have been invaluable.

I am also deeply thankful to *Sourav Saha*, Senior Research Fellow at ISI Kolkata, for his generous help in clarifying numerous technical doubts during this work. The first algorithm for Ideal Expanded Query (IEQ0) generation was originally written by him in Java using Lucene. I have rewritten the entire algorithm in PyLucene as part of this dissertation, based on his implementation.

I also thank the faculty and peers at the Indian Statistical Institute for providing an intellectually stimulating environment throughout my time here.
